default value that Image component is going to take. If a function is provided, the function will be called each time the app loads to set the initial value of this component.\n"," |          format: File format (e.g. \"png\" or \"gif\"). Used to save image if it does not already have a valid format (e.g. if the image is being returned to the frontend as a numpy array or PIL Image). The format should be supported by the PIL library. Applies both when this component is used as an input or output. This parameter has no effect on SVG files.\n"," |          height: The height of the component, specified in pixels if a number is passed, or in CSS units if a string is passed. This has no effect on the preprocessed image file or numpy array, but will affect the displayed image.\n"," |          width: The width of the component, specified in pixels if a number is passed, or in CSS units if a string is passed. This has no effect on the preprocessed image file or numpy array, but will affect the displayed image.\n"," |          image_mode: The pixel format and color depth that the image should be loaded and preprocessed as. \"RGB\" will load the image as a color image, or \"L\" as black-and-white. See https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/concepts.html for other supported image modes and their meaning. This parameter has no effect on SVG or GIF files. If set to None, the image_mode will be inferred from the image file type (e.g. \"RGBA\" for a .png image, \"RGB\" in most other cases).\n"," |          sources: List of sources for the image. \"upload\" creates a box where user can drop an image file, \"webcam\" allows user to take snapshot from their webcam, \"clipboard\" allows users to paste an image from the clipboard. If None, defaults to [\"upload\", \"webcam\", \"clipboard\"] if streaming is False, otherwise defaults to [\"webcam\"].\n"," |          type: The format the image is converted before being passed into the prediction function. \"numpy\" converts the image to a numpy array with shape (height, width, 3) and values from 0 to 255, \"pil\" converts the image to a PIL image object, \"filepath\" passes a str path to a temporary file containing the image. To support animated GIFs in input, the `type` should be set to \"filepath\" or \"pil\". To support SVGs, the `type` should be set to \"filepath\".\n"," |          label: the label for this component. Appears above the component and is also used as the header if there are a table of examples for this component. If None and used in a `gr.Interface`, the label will be the name of the parameter this component is assigned to.\n"," |          every: Continously calls `value` to recalculate it if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). Can provide a Timer whose tick resets `value`, or a float that provides the regular interval for the reset Timer.\n"," |          inputs: Components that are used as inputs to calculate `value` if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). `value` is recalculated any time the inputs change.\n"," |          show_label: if True, will display label.\n"," |          show_download_button: If True, will display button to download image. Only applies if interactive is False (e.g. if the component is used as an output).\n"," |          container: If True, will place the component in a container - providing some extra padding around the border.\n"," |          scale: relative size compared to adjacent Components. For example if Components A and B are in a Row, and A has scale=2, and B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B. Should be an integer. scale applies in Rows, and to top-level Components in Blocks where fill_height=True.\n"," |          min_width: minimum pixel width, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in this Component being narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.\n"," |          interactive: if True, will allow users to upload and edit an image; if False, can only be used to display images. If not provided, this is inferred based on whether the component is used as an input or output.\n"," |          visible: If False, component will be hidden.\n"," |          streaming: If True when used in a `live` interface, will automatically stream webcam feed. Only valid is source is 'webcam'. If the component is an output component, will automatically convert images to base64.\n"," |          elem_id: An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.\n"," |          elem_classes: An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.\n"," |          render: If False, component will not render be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.\n"," |          key: in a gr.render, Components with the same key across re-renders are treated as the same component, not a new component. Properties set in 'preserved_by_key' are not reset across a re-render.\n"," |          preserved_by_key: A list of parameters from this component's constructor. Inside a gr.render() function, if a component is re-rendered with the same key, these (and only these) parameters will be preserved in the UI (if they have been changed by the user or an event listener) instead of re-rendered based on the values provided during constructor.\n"," |          mirror_webcam: If True webcam will be mirrored. Default is True.\n"," |          show_share_button: If True, will show a share icon in the corner of the component that allows user to share outputs to Hugging Face Spaces Discussions. If False, icon does not appear. If set to None (default behavior), then the icon appears if this Gradio app is launched on Spaces, but not otherwise.\n"," |          placeholder: Custom text for the upload area. Overrides default upload messages when provided. Accepts new lines and `#` to designate a heading.\n"," |          show_fullscreen_button: If True, will show a fullscreen icon in the corner of the component that allows user to view the image in fullscreen mode. If False, icon does not appear.\n"," |          webcam_constraints: A dictionary that allows developers to specify custom media constraints for the webcam stream. This parameter provides flexibility to control the video stream's properties, such as resolution and front or rear camera on mobile devices. See $demo/webcam_constraints\n"," |\n"," |  api_info_as_output(self) -> 'dict[str, Any]'\n"," |\n"," |  change = event_trigger(block: 'Block | None', fn: \"Callable | None | Literal['decorator']\" = 'decorator', inputs: 'Component | BlockContext | Sequence[Component | BlockContext] | Set[Component | BlockContext] | None' = None, outputs: 'Component | BlockContext | Sequence[Component | BlockContext] | Set[Component | BlockContext] | None' = None, api_name: 'str | None | Literal[False]' = None, api_description: 'str | None | Literal[False]' = None, scroll_to_output: 'bool' = False, show_progress: \"Literal['full', 'minimal', 'hidden']\" = 'full', show_progress_on: 'Component | Sequence[Component] | None' = None, queue: 'bool' = True, batch: 'bool' = False, max_batch_size: 'int' = 4, preprocess: 'bool' = True, postprocess: 'bool' = True, cancels: 'dict[str, Any] | list[dict[str, Any]] | None' = None, trigger_mode: \"Literal['once', 'multiple', 'always_last'] | None\" = None, js: 'str | Literal[True] | None' = None, concurrency_limit: \"int | None | Literal['default']\" = 'default', concurrency_id: 'str | None' = None, show_api: 'bool' = True, time_limit: 'int | None' = None, stream_every: 'float' = 0.5, like_user_message: 'bool' = False, key: 'int | str | tuple[int | str, ...] | None' = None) -> 'Dependency' from gradio.events.EventListener._setup.<locals>\n"," |      Triggered when the value of the Image changes either because of user input (e.g. a user types in a textbox) OR because of a function update (e.g. an image receives a value from the output of an event trigger).

If None, will use GRADIO_ANALYTICS_ENABLED environment variable if defined, or default to True.\n"," |          batch: if True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.\n"," |          max_batch_size: the maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)\n"," |          api_name: defines how the prediction endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the API docs with the given name. If None, the name of the prediction function will be used as the API endpoint.

This css will be included in the demo webpage.\n"," |          css_paths: Custom css as a pathlib.Path to a css file or a list of such paths. This css files will be read, concatenated, and included in the demo webpage. If the `css` parameter is also set, the css from `css` will be included first.\n"," |          js: Custom js as a code string. The custom js should be in the form of a single js function. This function will automatically be executed when the page loads. For more flexibility, use the head parameter to insert js inside <script> tags.\n"," |          head: Custom html code to insert into the head of the demo webpage.

Components can either be passed as instantiated objects, or referred to by their string shortcuts. These components will be rendered in an accordion below the main input components. By default, no additional input components will be displayed.\n"," |          additional_inputs_accordion: if a string is provided, this is the label of the `gr.Accordion` to use to contain additional inputs. A `gr.Accordion` object can be provided as well to configure other properties of the container holding the additional inputs. Defaults to a `gr.Accordion(label=\"Additional Inputs\", open=False)`. This parameter is only used if `additional_inputs` is provided.\n"," |          submit_btn: the button to use for submitting inputs. Defaults to a `gr.Button(\"Submit\", variant=\"primary\")`. This parameter does not apply if the Interface is output-only, in which case the submit button always displays \"Generate\". Can be set to a string (which becomes the button label) or a `gr.Button` object (which allows for more customization).\n"," |          stop_btn: the button to use for stopping the interface. Defaults to a `gr.Button(\"Stop\", variant=\"stop\", visible=False)`. Can be set to a string (which becomes the button label) or a `gr.Button` object (which allows for more customization).\n"," |          clear_btn: the button to use for clearing the inputs. Defaults to a `gr.Button(\"Clear\", variant=\"secondary\")`. Can be set to a string (which becomes the button label) or a `gr.Button` object (which allows for more customization). Can be set to None, which hides the button.\n"," |          delete_cache: a tuple corresponding [frequency, age] both expressed in number of seconds. Every `frequency` seconds, the temporary files created by this Blocks instance will be deleted if more than `age` seconds have passed since the file was created. For example, setting this to (86400, 86400) will delete temporary files every day. The cache will be deleted entirely when the server restarts. If None, no cache deletion will occur.\n"," |          show_progress: how to show the progress animation while event is running: \"full\" shows a spinner which covers the output component area as well as a runtime display in the upper right corner, \"minimal\" only shows the runtime display, \"hidden\" shows no progress animation at all\n"," |          example_labels: a list of labels for each example. If provided, the length of this list should be the same as the number of examples, and these labels will be used in the UI instead of rendering the example values.\n"," |          fill_width: whether to horizontally expand to fill container fully. If False, centers and constrains app to a maximum width.\n"," |          time_limit: The time limit for the stream to run. Default is 30 seconds. Parameter only used for streaming images or audio if the interface is live and the input components are set to \"streaming=True\".\n"," |          stream_every: The latency (in seconds) at which stream chunks are sent to the backend.
